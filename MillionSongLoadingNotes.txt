Used Jupyter to export SQLite to CSV:

import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
db_path = '/Users/lydia/Projects/Beatstream/data/million_song_database.sqlite'
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cur = conn.cursor()

analysis_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM analysis", conn)
artist_mbtag_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM artist_mbtag", conn)
artist_term_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM artist_term", conn)
artists_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM artists", conn)
similarity_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM similarity", conn)
tracks_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM tracks", conn)


# Need to set index = False where the sqlite table has a primary key, otherwise there's an extra column in the csv

analysis_df.to_csv(f'/Users/lydia/Projects/Beatstream/data/analysis.csv', index = False)
artist_mbtag_df.to_csv(f'/Users/lydia/Projects/Beatstream/data/artist_mbtag.csv')
artist_term_df.to_csv(f'/Users/lydia/Projects/Beatstream/data/artist_term.csv')
artists_df.to_csv(f'/Users/lydia/Projects/Beatstream/data/artists.csv', index = False)
similarity_df.to_csv(f'/Users/lydia/Projects/Beatstream/data/similarity.csv')
tracks_df.to_csv(f'/Users/lydia/Projects/Beatstream/data/tracks.csv')


Created million database in MySQL

Created the tables in MySQL using the SQLAlchemy in Python (million_connection.py)



Then loaded CSV to MySQL using Terminal.

Note: Have to launch MySQL with permission to load local files:

mysql --local-infile=1 -u lydia -p

USE million
